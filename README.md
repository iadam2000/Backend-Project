Hi, Welcome to my backend project!

First things first, any .env files are not included in git pushes, so you'll 
need to create environment variables yourself.
You can do this by creating two files:

1 - '.env.development'
2 - '.env.test'

Each of these can allow you to play around with actual data and dummy data respectively

Inside each file, write the following:
PGDATABASE= <db_name_here>
the db_name can be found in ./db/setup.sql
